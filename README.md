# PyTorch Scholarship Challenge from Facebook

![alt text](https://github.com/taimurzahid/PyTorch-Scholarship-Challenge/blob/master/pytorchudacityscholar.png)

PyTorch is an open source end-to-end deep learning platform developed by Facebook Artificial Intelligence which enables fast, flexible, and efficient production which is built as a python-first framework.

This repository contains the content that is related to the First Phase of the PyTorch Scholarship Challenge Program from Facebook and Udacity. 

For the first phase of this Challenge had 10,000 people from around the world. 

On the basis of the following criterion, the selection of the second phase took place:
1. Successful completion of the Challenge Course
2. Level of participation and support of classmates in the student community
3. Re-assessment of essays from the original scholarship application
4. All the selection criteria used in Phase 1

## After completing the above criteria, it's an honour to be selected among those top 300 students and receive Scholarship for the Deep Learning Nanodegree.
