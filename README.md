# PyTorch Scholarship Challenge from Facebook

![alt text](https://github.com/taimurzahid/PyTorch-Scholarship-Challenge/blob/master/pytorchudacityscholar.png)

PyTorch is an open source end-to-end deep learning platform developed by Facebook which enables fast, flexible, and efficient production which is built as a python-first framework.

From the 10,000 original participants, 300 will be selected for the full Nanodegree program scholarship for the Deep Learning Nanodegree Program.
